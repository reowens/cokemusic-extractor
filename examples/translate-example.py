Reference consumer of the Rail A JSON schema.

What this script does
---------------------
Reads one `extracted/<room>.json` produced by ``extract/extract_room.py``
and emits a generic per-room summary as pretty-printed JSON on stdout.
The summary groups cast members by Director member type, previews the
three structured-XML text bodies (MapXml / SceneXml / EntryXml), and —
if ``--output-root`` is passed — resolves each bitmap member's name to
its expected PNG path under ``<output_root>/rooms/<room>/`` (the
convention Rail B's bitmap dumpers write to).

The output shape is intentionally generic. Anyone wiring CokeMusic
casts into their own runtime / engine / archive needs to know
*how to walk* the extracted JSON; this script demonstrates the
walk in stdlib Python, no third-party deps. Take it as
documentation-by-example, not as a production translator.

What this script is NOT
-----------------------
- It is **not a runtime**. It does not parse layouts into tile
  coordinates, walk grids, render anything, or load the actual
  bitmap bytes. It only reports what is *present* in the extraction.
- It is **not a tool-specific translator**. The shape it emits is
  generic, with no per-project field names. The extraction's
  text_bodies (MapXml / SceneXml / EntryXml) carry XML that downstream
  consumers parse however their runtime needs — see the comments at
  ``_summarize_xml_body`` for what's in each.
- It is **not exhaustive**. Director cast members may carry more
  metadata than ``extract_room.py`` extracts (palette refs, regPoints,
  bit depths) — that lives in Rail B's ``_members.json`` sidecars.
  See ``docs/SCHEMA.md`` for the canonical schema.

Usage
-----
    python3 examples/translate-example.py <extracted/room.json>
    python3 examples/translate-example.py <extracted/room.json> --output-root <abs/path>

The optional ``--output-root`` should point at the directory tree
written by Rail B's ``dump_cct_bitmaps`` (i.e. the ``<OUTPUT_ROOT>``
env var passed to that test). When set, each bitmap member entry
gains a ``bitmap_path`` field that is either an existing absolute
path or ``null`` if the dumper hasn't written that member yet.

Exit codes:
    0  success
    1  extracted JSON file not found
    2  extracted JSON could not be parsed
