"""WIP-clobber guard for generator scripts.

Generators (translate_all.py, translate_room.py, etc.) regenerate tracked
files in the working tree. If the user has uncommitted edits in those
files (in-flight WIP from a parallel session), a naive `path.write_text(...)`
silently destroys that work.

`safe_write` refuses to overwrite a tracked file that has working-tree
modifications vs HEAD, unless `force=True` is passed. New (untracked) files
write freely. Identical content is a no-op (avoids touching mtime).

Usage:

    from _safe_write import safe_write, WIPClobberError

    try:
        safe_write(dst, content, force=args.force)
    except WIPClobberError as e:
        print(f"SKIP  {e}", file=sys.stderr)
        # caller decides: skip, abort, prompt, etc.
